This github repository contains the code used to perform our research. We compared 2 different capsule network routings and a simple CNN model.
The architecture of the two capsule networks can be found in the models folder. The code of the capsule layers themselves can be found in the utils folder in layers and layers_hinton for the self attention and dynamic routing respectively.
The CNN model was implemented in its entirety in the CNN_model.py file.
